### What would you do in case you face or witness such behaviour?

If we face or witness sexual harassment:

1. **Speak Up**: Politely but firmly we should ask the person to stop.
2. **Document It**: Write down the details (dates, actions, witnesses) about the incident happened.
3. **Report The Behaviour**: Inform a trusted authority like HR, or manager, or a designated committee.
4. **Seek Support**: Talk to friends, family, or counselors to help you handle the situation.

Always remember, speaking up can help to stop the behavior and protect others too.
