# Good Practices For Software Development

### Question 1. Which point(s) were new to me?

1. Over-Communicate Scenario:

    - The emphasis on keeping the team updated for scenarios like internet or laptop issues stood out. While in day-to-day life, it is often ignored by us.
    - The suggestion to use the group chats over private DM's for increased visibility was insightful as other members can also guide things to resolve the issues.

2. Question Clarity:

    - The emphasis on detailed problem explanations, including screenshots and other tools like Loom or GitHub gists, was a great reminder of the importance of effective communication.
    - The scenario of comparing the issues in large open-source projects.

3. Involvement Principles:

    - "Work when you work, play when you play" as a guiding rule was simple yet powerful.
    - The suggestion to block social media and track time using tools like Boosted to track time was new and practical.

### Question 2. Which area do I think, I need to improve on? What are my ideas to make progress in that area?

1. Improving Communication:

    - Actively updating with the team about my current changes or challenges.
    - I should begin using the team channels for updates instead of direct messages to enhance transparency among the team.
    - I should keep my video on, in the meetings to build the rapport among the team members.

2. Focused Work (Deep Work):

    - I should use the tools like **Freedom** to block distracting websites.
    - I should turn off all non-essential notifications.
    - I should establish a structured work schedule with breaks for exercise and meals.

3. Getting To Know My Teammates:

    - I should join the meetings a few minutes early to chat casually with team members.
    - Scheduling a quick one-on-one calls to better understand their schedules and working styles.
