# Focus Management

### Question 1. What is Deep Work?

-   Deep Work, a concept introduced by Cal Newport, refers to professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push cognitive capabilities to their limit.
-   These efforts create new value, improve skills, and are hard to replicate.
-   In contrast, shallow work consists of non-cognitively demanding tasks often performed while distracted, which do not create much new value and are easy to replicate.
