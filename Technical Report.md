# What is OOP?

OOP stands for "Object-Oriented Programming," and its core principles are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism; essentially, these principles allow programmers to design software by creating "objects" that represent real-world entities, with each object containing its own data (attributes) and behaviors (methods), enabling them to interact with each other in a structured way. 

**The Four Principles of OOP are :**

***Encapsulation :***
     This principle involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) together within a class, restricting direct access to data and ensuring data integrity by only allowing modifications through defined methods. 

The below is the sample code for encapsulation.

***Abstraction :***
     This principle focuses on hiding unnecessary details of an object and only exposing the essential functionalities that users need to know about, simplifying the interaction with the object.

***Inheritance :***
     This principle allows new classes (child classes) to inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes (parent classes), promoting code reuse and reducing redundancy. 
     The below is a sample code for Inheritance and it's hierarchy diagram.

***Polymorphism :***
      This principle enables objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways depending on their type, allowing for flexible and adaptable code. 

There are two types of Polymorphism:

   **1.Method overlaoding :** Method Overloading means defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within a single class, allowing for different behaviors based on the arguments provided. 

   **2.MethodOverriding :** Method overriding occurs when a child class redefines a method inherited from its parent class, essentially changing the behavior of that method within the child class, requiring inheritance between classes. 
      The below is a sample code for Method overlaoding and Method overriding.

## Key points about OOP:
**Classes and Objects:** A "class" acts as a blueprint for creating objects, defining the attributes and methods that all objects of that class will have.

**Object interaction:** Objects communicate with each other by sending messages, invoking methods on other objects. 

**Benefits of OOP:** Reusability, maintainability, modularity, and better code organization.
