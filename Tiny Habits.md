# Tiny Habits

### Question 1. In the video, what was the most interesting story or idea for me?

-   The most interesting idea was how small habits, when connected to something we already do, it can bring big changes in our life.
-   For example, the story of starting a habit by just flossing one tooth and slowly building on that stood out.
-   It shows how starting small and making things easy can help us form habits.

### Question 2. How can we use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

-   B = MAP means Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt.
-   To make new habits easier:

    -   **M (Motivation)**: We should connect the habit to something we find meaningful or rewarding.
    -   **A (Ability)**: We should make the habit so simple that it takes very little effort to do.
    -   **P (Prompt)**: We should use the reminders to trigger the habit.

-   For example, to start drinking more water, we should keep a water bottle on our desk, start with small sips (easy), and think about the benefits for your health (motivation).

### Question 3. Why it is important to "Shine" or "Celebrate" after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever we celebrate becomes a habit).

-   Celebrating helps us feel good about the habit.
-   When we celebrate after completing a habit, our brain connects the habit to happiness, making it easier to repeat.
-   This positive feeling makes the habit stronger.

### Question 4. In the video, what was the most interesting story or idea for me.

-   The idea that "emotions create habits, not repetition" was very interesting.
-   Instead of forcing a habit with willpower, connecting it to positive emotions, like smiling or doing a small celebration, makes it more effective and easier to stick to.

### Question 5. What is the book's perspective about Identity?

-   The book says habits are not just about actions but about who we want to become.
-   For example, instead of thinking "I want to exercise," say, "I am the kind of person who exercises daily."
-   When we connect habits with our identity, we are more likely to follow them.

### Question 6. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

-   To make a habit easier:
    -   Break the habits into a very simple action.
    -   Remove the obstacles and make things convenient.
    -   Ensure the habit is easy to do based on our current skill or energy level.
    -   Attach the habit to something we already do or a visual cue.
-   For example, to start exercising, begin with just one push-up. Slowly increase the number over-time.

### Question 7. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

-   To make a habit harder:
    -   Create barriers so the habit becomes less convenient.
    -   Take away the triggers that remind us to do the habit.
    -   Associate the habit with negative consequences or feelings.
-   For instance, to use your phone less, turn off notifications, log out of apps, or leave your phone in another room.

    -   Make it harder by deleting the apps temporarily or by setting the daily limits.
    -   Remind ourself of how much time gets wasted and what else we could achieve.
